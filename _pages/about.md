I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.ucas.edu.cn/), [University of Chinese Academic Science](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research interest includes statistical machine learning, transfer learning and graph model.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sanguo Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~sgzhang?language=en) from School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academic Science.
