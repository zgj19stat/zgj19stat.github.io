I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.ucas.edu.cn/), [University of Chinese Academic Science](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by [Prof. Sanguo Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~sgzhang?language=en). Recent works focus on Transfer Learning, Multi-Layers/Time-varying Networks Analysis. 

I am actively seeking and welcoming research collaborations. My interests cover many of the current focal points in the machine learning and deep learning community, with a particular emphasis on:

- Contrastive Learning

- Federated Learning

- Continual Learning

- In-Context Learning

- Generative Models

- ...

I am passionate about exploring these areas from both theoretical and applied perspectives. If you share these interests or have an idea for a potential project, please feel free to contact me via email to begin a discussion.
