Human disease network (HDN) analysis, which jointly considers a large number of diseases and focuses on their interconnections, is getting increasingly popular and can shed important insight not possessed by individual-disease-based analysis. Multiple network analysis techniques have been developed for HDNs, although new developments are still strongly needed. In this article, we adopt latent space modeling, which has been shown as powerful in other network analysis contents, has unique and insightful interpretations, but has been limitedly adopted in HDN analysis. Different from some other types of network analysis and some other HDN analyses (such as genecentric ones), in this article, we pay unique attention to modeling temporal variations. For this purpose, a penalization approach is developed, which can identify time regions with constant network structures (that correspond to ignorable changes) as well as those with smooth variations. The statistical and computational properties are rigorously established. With Medicare data - one of the most powerful medical claims data, we analyze the admission records of 133 million hospital inpatient treatments from January 2008 to December 2019. Sensible findings are made on disease interconnections and clustering structures. Additionally, the temporal variations, which have not been revealed in the literature, are found to be interpretable. The analysis can provide a new way for connecting and grouping diseases and assist understanding and planning medical resources.
